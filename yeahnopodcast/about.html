            <p>Yeah No Yeah is the fat brain baby of two very old men trapped in the bodies of two sort-of young women: Molly Kendrick and Katie Joy. Molly met Katie when they both lived in Austin and shared a co-working space. When they first met, Katie
              said, “Here’s who I don’t like,” and Molly knew she had a new best friend, and also that she really missed the East Coast.</p>

            <p>At the time, Molly was dating an audio engineer, so it was only natural that they put all that sound equipment to some use. They started a (very embarrassing) podcast called “Ask the Meatloaf Twins.” (Molly loves making meatloaf, Katie loves
              Meatloaf the singer. It was based on a couples’ Halloween costume that never came to be.) After 11 episodes, Molly and the audio engineer broke up, so they sought a fresh start with Yeah No Yeah and one of Austin’s finest part-time sound
              guys, Chris (who made our intro and made us believe in love again).</p>

            <p>Season 1 of Yeah No Yeah focused on advice, but after 19 episodes — and a brush with local fame when they hosted two live episodes at Dozen Street — they decided they were tired of badgering friends for questions. Katie moved back to New York
              City to run her company and Molly conveniently decided she was done with Texas forever. Now they’re ready to hear your ghost stories, favorite folklore, urban legends, and scarier Tinder dates: <a href="mailto:yeahnopodcast@gmail.com">yeahnopodcast@gmail.com</a>.</p>
